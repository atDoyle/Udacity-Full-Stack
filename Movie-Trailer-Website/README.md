# Movie Trailer Website

Server-side code to store a list of movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. This code is then used to generate a static web page allowing visitors to browse their movies and watch the trailers.

## Getting Started

This project uses 3 python files to create an HTML file which then can be viewed in a web browser.

### Prerequisites

In addition to downloaded the 3 python files and storing them in the same location, it is necessary to download Python 2.7 in order to execute these files which are used to create the webpage.

### Installing

If you do not have Python 2.7 installed on your computer, the most recent version can be downloaded from the [Downloads page on the Python Software Foundation website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Creating the Web Page

The web page can be created by running the entertainment_center.py file.  This will generate and automatically create the HTML file that can be used to view the information regarding the movies.
